<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="overhauling-the-mlflow-docs">Overhauling the MLflow Docs<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/mlflow-site-refresh/blog/2023/10/31/mlflow-docs-overhaul#overhauling-the-mlflow-docs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Overhauling the MLflow Docs" title="Direct link to Overhauling the MLflow Docs">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>We're thrilled to announce a comprehensive overhaul of the MLflow Docs. This initiative is not just about refreshing the look and feel but about reimagining how our users interact with our content. Our primary goal is to enhance clarity, improve navigation, and provide more in-depth resources for our community.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-renewed-focus-on-user-experience">A Renewed Focus on User Experience<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/mlflow-site-refresh/blog/2023/10/31/mlflow-docs-overhaul#a-renewed-focus-on-user-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A Renewed Focus on User Experience" title="Direct link to A Renewed Focus on User Experience">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>The MLflow documentation has always been an essential resource for our users. Over time, we've received invaluable feedback, and we've listened. The modernization effort is a direct response to the needs and preferences of our community.</p>
<p>Along with working on covering new cutting-edge features as part of this documentation overhaul, we're working on addressing the complexity of getting started. As the first part of a series of tutorials and guides focusing on the initial learning phase, we've created a new <a href="https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/getting-started/logging-first-model/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting started guide</a>, the first of many in a new series we're working on in an effort to teach the fundamentals of using MLflow. We feel that more in-depth instructional tutorials for learning the concepts and tools of MLflow will help to enhance the user experience for not only new users, but experienced users who need a refresher of how to do certain tasks.</p>
<p>There are more of these coming in the future!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="easier-navigation"><strong>Easier Navigation</strong><a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/mlflow-site-refresh/blog/2023/10/31/mlflow-docs-overhaul#easier-navigation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to easier-navigation" title="Direct link to easier-navigation">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Our first order of business is to declutter and reorganize. This is going to be a process, though. With some of the monolithic pages (<a href="https://www.mlflow.org/docs/2.7.1/models.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mlflow Models</a>), this will be more of a marathon than a sprint.</p>
<p>We've introduced a <a href="https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new main navigation page</a> in an effort to help steer you to the content that you're looking for based on end-use domain, rather than component of MLflow. We're hoping that this helps to bring new feature content and useful examples to your awareness, limiting the amount of exploratory discovery needed to understand how to use these new features.</p>
<p>Another priority for us was to make major new features easier to discover. While the <a href="https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">release notes</a> are useful, particularly for Engineers who are maintaining integrations with, or are managing a deployment of, MLflow, they're not particularly user-friendly for an end-user of MLflow. We felt that a curated list of major new features would help to distill the information in our release notes, so we built the <a href="https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/new-features/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new features</a> page. We sincerely hope it helps to reduce the amount of effort needed to know what new major features have been released.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="interactive-learning-with-notebooks"><strong>Interactive Learning with Notebooks</strong><a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/mlflow-site-refresh/blog/2023/10/31/mlflow-docs-overhaul#interactive-learning-with-notebooks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to interactive-learning-with-notebooks" title="Direct link to interactive-learning-with-notebooks">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>In today's fast-paced tech world, interactive learning is becoming the norm. Recognizing this trend, we're embedding viewable notebooks directly within the docs. But we're not stopping there. These notebooks are downloadable, allowing you to run, modify, and experiment with them locally. It's a hands-on approach to learning, bridging the gap between theory and practice.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="in-depth-tutorials-and-guides"><strong>In-depth Tutorials and Guides</strong><a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/mlflow-site-refresh/blog/2023/10/31/mlflow-docs-overhaul#in-depth-tutorials-and-guides" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to in-depth-tutorials-and-guides" title="Direct link to in-depth-tutorials-and-guides">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>While our previous documentation provided a solid foundation, we felt there was room for more detailed explorations. We're introducing comprehensive <a href="https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/traditional-ml/creating-custom-pyfunc/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tutorials</a> and <a href="https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/llm-evaluate/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guides</a> that delve deep into MLflow's features, showing how to solve actual problems. These first new tutorials and guides are just the start. We're going to be spending a lot of time and effort on making much more of MLflow documented in this way, helping to dramatically reduce the amount of time you have to spend figuring out how to leverage features in MLflow.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="diving-deeper-expanding-on-guides-and-tutorials">Diving Deeper: Expanding on Guides and Tutorials<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/mlflow-site-refresh/blog/2023/10/31/mlflow-docs-overhaul#diving-deeper-expanding-on-guides-and-tutorials" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Diving Deeper: Expanding on Guides and Tutorials" title="Direct link to Diving Deeper: Expanding on Guides and Tutorials">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>Our dedication to simplifying the usage of MLflow shines through in our revamped tutorials and guides. We're not just providing instructions; we're offering <a href="https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/custom-pyfunc-for-llms/notebooks/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deep dives</a>, <a href="https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/traditional-ml/hyperparameter-tuning-with-child-runs/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best practices</a>, and real-world applications.
